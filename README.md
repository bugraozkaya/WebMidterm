# WebMidterm# Tech Solutions Inc. - Company Team Page

## 📌 Project Description
This project was developed for the **CNG-361 Web Programming Midterm Lab**. The main objective was to fix a broken HTML structure ("Fix the Foundation") and build a responsive, modern "Team Section" using **Bootstrap 5** and **SASS (SCSS)** ("Build and Polish").

The project demonstrates semantic HTML usage, Bootstrap grid system implementation, and custom styling with SASS variables, nesting, and mixins.
